Hi Team, 

I would like to thank you all for considering me as a candidate for employment. This project was pretty challenging for me and I wish I had more time to play with it as far as implementation and modification. I chose mySQL as the langauge because I felt the count function was the best way to tally a number of Strings or varchars. It was actually a little harder for me than I imagined as I was more inclined to use an OOP language like Java or Python. However I believe in challenging yourself to gather information, combine it with experience and determine the solutions to the problem at hand. I explained issues and code within the file itself. 

Thanks again

Mark K. Kwayisi
